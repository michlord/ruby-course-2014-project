We had our good share of sequels and prequels ranging from The Planet of Apes series to spider-man, X-men, Hobbit, how to train your dragon, 300, Hunger games, 22 jump street, horrible bosses two, dumb and dumber two, transformers, expendables and.... *Sigh* it doesn't stop here there's more to them a lot more but it isn't about all of these.\n\n                  The movie starts as a normal murder mystery and somewhere 15-20 minutes in the movie you'd be like what makes it deserve all that appreciation? But wait, it hasn't even started yet. It isn't all what it seems like and one surely can't judge the book by its cover in this case. The movie is fully of surprises and at the end of it you'd be all smiles that's all i can say!\n\n                  I'm not here to give away spoilers but if you haven't watched this masterpiece yet just rush back home and order it on Netflix or buy the DVD.",

Not \nonly does it have the impressive set pieces and enough action to last \nyou a lifetime, it has an emotional core and you actually get to care \nabout each and every single character. Overall this movie is filled with\n all the required thrills and spills and is a first class action movie. \nIt also has a great mixture of comedic value and a deal of seriousness. \n\nThe\n film's unlikely hero is Quill (Chris Pratt), an eccentric gunfighter in\n the Han Solo mould who we meet stealing a metal orb coveted by the evil\n warlord Ronan. When he dispatches his top assassin, the green- skinned \nGamora (Zoe Saldana), to recover the artifact, the pair find themselves \nlocked up, along with the galaxy's most unlikely bounty hunters – a \ngun-toting raccoon (Bradley Cooper) and his sidekick (Vin Diesel) who \njust happens to be a walking tree. All the actors do a great job at \nportraying there characters, they feel real beings. You get to know \nabout them and their struggles and you become attached to them. Every \ncharacter in the movie got their time to shine, especially Rocket \nRaccoon who is voiced perfectly by Bradley Cooper. Everyone is pitch \nperfect in their roles even Batista! \n\nFor those that want \nspecifics: effects were top notch, acting was excellent, story lines \nwere compelling, the comedy was perfect 99.5% of the time and surprise \nthere were a lot of one line typical superhero zingers that worked \nreally well. What really can't be stressed enough is just how insanely \nfun and entertaining Guardians of the Galaxy is for literally its entire\n two-hour-plus run-time. I still have a hard time wrestling with who was\n my favorite actor in this. all in all, the film is brilliantly well \ndone, action scenes are engrossing and genuinely done, you genuinely \nworry about certain characters and I for one was thrilled with it. Go \nsee this.",

Huge mistake.\n\nTo say the movie is childish would be an honor for this movie, I have\nseen plenty of animated movies which were a huge lot better.\n\nThe story is dumb and entirely predictable. The characters are almost\nflat and have absolutely no credibility from either a serious point of\nview nor from a parody point of view. Acting was also poor.\n\nVisual effects were OK and being a 3D movie helped, but that is the\nonly positive thing that I can say about the movie.\n\nThe theater was half-full but during the entire movie there was not a\nsingle time when you could hear everybody laughing hard.\n\nThe only way I can imagine that so many 9 and 10 star reviews were\nadded for this movie is since all the brainwashed Marvel fan-boys and\nsock-puppets for the studios somehow managed to overwhelm normal\nreviewers.\n",

Armed with hidden skills that allow him to serve vengeance against anyone who would brutalize the helpless, McCall comes out of his self-imposed retirement and finds his desire for justice reawakened. If someone has a problem, if the odds are stacked against them, if they have nowhere else to turn, McCall will help. He is The Equalizer.",
